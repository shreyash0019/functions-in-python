# Functions in Python

This repository contains examples demonstrating the use of functions in Python. Each file showcases a different approach to implementing basic mathematical operations or handling specific tasks.

## Repository Structure

### Files and Descriptions

1. **functionEx4.py**  
   Demonstrates multiple ways of returning and using the result of a function that adds two numbers. It includes:
   - Direct unpacking of return values.
   - Tuple-based indexing for flexibility.  
   **Usage Example:**  
   ```
   enter first value: 5
   enter second value: 10
   5.0+10.0=15.0
   ```

2. **functionEx6.py**  
   Contains a function to calculate the circumference of a circle given its radius.  
   **Usage Example:**  
   ```
   Enter the value of radius: 7
   The circumference of the circle is = 43.96
   ```

3. **functions.py**  
   A script for adding two numbers using a reusable function. This file demonstrates:
   - Function calling with arguments.
   - Printing results in a formatted way.  
   **Usage Example:**  
   ```
   Enter first value: 3
   Enter second value: 4
   3.0+4.0= 7.0
   ```
